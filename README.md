## HR-Attrition-Dashboard
This project presents an interactive HR Attrition Dashboard built in Tableau to analyze employee turnover patterns within an organization. The goal of the dashboard is to identify key factors influencing attrition and provide data-driven insights to support HR decision-making and workforce planning.

The dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency in fields such as age groups, departments, job roles, salary bands, and years at the company. Calculated fields were created to determine attrition rate, employee distribution, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Key Metrics Analyzed:

Overall Attrition Rate (%)

Total Employees vs. Employees Who Left

Attrition by Department

Attrition by Job Role

Attrition by Age Group

Attrition by Salary Band

Attrition by Years at Company

Gender-based Attrition Comparison
